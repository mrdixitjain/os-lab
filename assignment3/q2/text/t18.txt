 Chapter 1. Marseillesâ€”The Arrival

On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde
signalled the three-master, the _Pharaon_ from Smyrna, Trieste, and
Naples.

As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If,
got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.

Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean
were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a
ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the _Pharaon_,
has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs
to an owner of the city.

The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic
shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled
PomÃ¨gue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker,
but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is
the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have
happened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly
that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself,
for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the
anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by
the side of the pilot, who was steering the _Pharaon_ towards the
narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity
and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each
direction of the pilot.

The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much
affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the
vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled
alongside the _Pharaon_, which he reached as she rounded into La
RÃ©serve basin.

When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his
station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the shipâ€™s
bulwarks.

He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with
black eyes, and hair as dark as a ravenâ€™s wing; and his whole
appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men
accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.

â€œAh, is it you, DantÃ¨s?â€ cried the man in the skiff. â€œWhatâ€™s the
matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?â€

â€œA great misfortune, M. Morrel,â€ replied the young man, â€œa great
misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave
Captain Leclere.â€

â€œAnd the cargo?â€ inquired the owner, eagerly.

â€œIs all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that
head. But poor Captain Leclereâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat happened to him?â€ asked the owner, with an air of considerable
resignation. â€œWhat happened to the worthy captain?â€

â€œHe died.â€

â€œFell into the sea?â€

â€œNo, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.â€ Then turning to
the crew, he said, â€œBear a hand there, to take in sail!â€

All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the
crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and
outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail
clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his
orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to
the owner.

â€œAnd how did this misfortune occur?â€ inquired the latter, resuming the
interrupted conversation.

0023m



â€œAlas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the
harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.
In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days
afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his
rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head
and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword
and cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,â€ added the young man
with a melancholy smile, â€œto make war against the English for ten
years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.â€

â€œWhy, you see, Edmond,â€ replied the owner, who appeared more comforted
at every moment, â€œwe are all mortal, and the old must make way for the
young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure
me that the cargoâ€”â€”â€

â€œIs all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise
you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.â€

Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:
â€œStand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!â€

The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a
man-of-war.

â€œLet goâ€”and clue up!â€ At this last command all the sails were lowered,
and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.

â€œNow, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,â€ said DantÃ¨s, observing the
ownerâ€™s impatience, â€œhere is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out
of his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I
must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.â€

The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which
DantÃ¨s flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit
to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man,
going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came
towards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of
age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors,
insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as
responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors,
made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond DantÃ¨s was beloved by
them.

â€œWell, M. Morrel,â€ said Danglars, â€œyou have heard of the misfortune
that has befallen us?â€

â€œYesâ€”yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.â€

â€œAnd a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service,
as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as
that of Morrel & Son,â€ replied Danglars.

â€œBut,â€ replied the owner, glancing after DantÃ¨s, who was watching the
anchoring of his vessel, â€œit seems to me that a sailor needs not be so
old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend
Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require
instruction from anyone.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate.
â€œYes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was
the captainâ€™s breath out of his body when he assumed the command
without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at
the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.â€

0025m



â€œAs to taking command of the vessel,â€ replied Morrel, â€œthat was his
duty as captainâ€™s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of
Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.â€

â€œThe vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are,
M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the
pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.â€

â€œDantÃ¨s,â€ said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, â€œcome this
way!â€

â€œIn a moment, sir,â€ answered DantÃ¨s, â€œand Iâ€™m with you.â€ Then calling
to the crew, he said, â€œLet go!â€

The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through
the port-hole. DantÃ¨s continued at his post in spite of the presence of
the pilot, until this manÅ“uvre was completed, and then he added,
â€œHalf-mast the colors, and square the yards!â€

â€œYou see,â€ said Danglars, â€œhe fancies himself captain already, upon my
word.â€

â€œAnd so, in fact, he is,â€ said the owner.

â€œExcept your signature and your partnerâ€™s, M. Morrel.â€

â€œAnd why should he not have this?â€ asked the owner; â€œhe is young, it is
true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.â€

A cloud passed over Danglarsâ€™ brow.

â€œYour pardon, M. Morrel,â€ said DantÃ¨s, approaching, â€œthe vessel now
rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?â€

Danglars retreated a step or two. â€œI wished to inquire why you stopped
at the Island of Elba?â€

â€œI do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain
Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.â€

â€œThen did you see him, Edmond?â€

â€œWho?â€

â€œThe marshal.â€

â€œYes.â€

Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing DantÃ¨s on one side, he said
suddenlyâ€”

â€œAnd how is the emperor?â€

â€œVery well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.â€

â€œYou saw the emperor, then?â€

â€œHe entered the marshalâ€™s apartment while I was there.â€

â€œAnd you spoke to him?â€

â€œWhy, it was he who spoke to me, sir,â€ said DantÃ¨s, with a smile.

â€œAnd what did he say to you?â€

â€œAsked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the
course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not
been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I
told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel &
Son. â€˜Ah, yes,â€™ he said, â€˜I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners
from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same
regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.â€™â€

â€œ_Pardieu!_ and that is true!â€ cried the owner, greatly delighted. â€œAnd
that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain.
DantÃ¨s, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you
will see it will bring tears into the old soldierâ€™s eyes. Come, come,â€
continued he, patting Edmondâ€™s shoulder kindly, â€œyou did very right,
DantÃ¨s, to follow Captain Leclereâ€™s instructions, and touch at Elba,
although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the
marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into
trouble.â€

0027m



â€œHow could that bring me into trouble, sir?â€ asked DantÃ¨s; â€œfor I did
not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made
such inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are
the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.â€ And
the young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached,
and said,â€”

â€œWell, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his
landing at Porto-Ferrajo?â€

â€œYes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.â€

â€œWell, so much the better,â€ said the supercargo; â€œfor it is not
pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.â€

â€œDantÃ¨s has done his,â€ replied the owner, â€œand that is not saying much.
It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.â€

â€œTalking of Captain Leclere, has not DantÃ¨s given you a letter from
him?â€

â€œTo me?â€”noâ€”was there one?â€

â€œI believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter
to his care.â€

â€œOf what packet are you speaking, Danglars?â€

â€œWhy, that which DantÃ¨s left at Porto-Ferrajo.â€

â€œHow do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?â€

Danglars turned very red.

â€œI was passing close to the door of the captainâ€™s cabin, which was half
open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to DantÃ¨s.â€

â€œHe did not speak to me of it,â€ replied the shipowner; â€œbut if there be
any letter he will give it to me.â€

Danglars reflected for a moment. â€œThen, M. Morrel, I beg of you,â€ said
he, â€œnot to say a word to DantÃ¨s on the subject. I may have been
mistaken.â€

At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.

â€œWell, my dear DantÃ¨s, are you now free?â€ inquired the owner.

â€œYes, sir.â€

â€œYou have not been long detained.â€

â€œNo. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and
as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I
gave them.â€

â€œThen you have nothing more to do here?â€

â€œNoâ€”everything is all right now.â€

â€œThen you can come and dine with me?â€

â€œI really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due
to my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have
done me.â€

0029m



â€œRight, DantÃ¨s, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.â€

â€œAnd,â€ inquired DantÃ¨s, with some hesitation, â€œdo you know how my
father is?â€

â€œWell, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.â€

â€œYes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.â€

â€œThat proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your
absence.â€

DantÃ¨s smiled. â€œMy father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left,
I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from
Heaven.â€

â€œWell, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on
you.â€

â€œI must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has
been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.â€

â€œTrue, DantÃ¨s, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who
expects you no less impatiently than your fatherâ€”the lovely MercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

DantÃ¨s blushed.

â€œAh, ha,â€ said the shipowner, â€œI am not in the least surprised, for she
has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the
_Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!â€

â€œShe is not my mistress,â€ replied the young sailor, gravely; â€œshe is my
betrothed.â€

â€œSometimes one and the same thing,â€ said Morrel, with a smile.

â€œNot with us, sir,â€ replied DantÃ¨s.

â€œWell, well, my dear Edmond,â€ continued the owner, â€œdonâ€™t let me detain
you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all
the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?â€

â€œNo, sir; I have all my pay to takeâ€”nearly three monthsâ€™ wages.â€

â€œYou are a careful fellow, Edmond.â€

â€œSay I have a poor father, sir.â€

â€œYes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see
your father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those
who detained him from me after a three monthsâ€™ voyage.â€

â€œThen I have your leave, sir?â€

â€œYes, if you have nothing more to say to me.â€

â€œNothing.â€

â€œCaptain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?â€

â€œHe was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your
leave of absence for some days.â€

â€œTo get married?â€

â€œYes, first, and then to go to Paris.â€

â€œVery good; have what time you require, DantÃ¨s. It will take quite six
weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until
three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the
_Pharaon_,â€ added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back,
â€œcannot sail without her captain.â€

â€œWithout her captain!â€ cried DantÃ¨s, his eyes sparkling with animation;
â€œpray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes
of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the
_Pharaon_?â€

â€œIf I were sole owner weâ€™d shake hands on it now, my dear DantÃ¨s, and
call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian
proverbâ€”_Chi ha compagno ha padrone_â€”â€˜He who has a partner has a
master.â€™ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of
two votes. Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.â€

â€œAh, M. Morrel,â€ exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes,
and grasping the ownerâ€™s hand, â€œM. Morrel, I thank you in the name of
my father and of MercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œThatâ€™s all right, Edmond. Thereâ€™s a providence that watches over the
deserving. Go to your father; go and see MercÃ©dÃ¨s, and afterwards come
to me.â€

â€œShall I row you ashore?â€

â€œNo, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with
Danglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?â€

â€œThat is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you
mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the
day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose
to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle
the disputeâ€”a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite
right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the
question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you
will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.â€

â€œBut tell me, DantÃ¨s, if you had command of the _Pharaon_ should you be
glad to see Danglars remain?â€

â€œCaptain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect
for those who possess the ownersâ€™ confidence.â€

â€œThatâ€™s right, thatâ€™s right, DantÃ¨s! I see you are a thoroughly good
fellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you
are.â€

â€œThen I have leave?â€

â€œGo, I tell you.â€

â€œMay I have the use of your skiff?â€

â€œCertainly.â€

â€œThen, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!â€

â€œI hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.â€

The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern
sheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La CanebiÃ¨re. The two
oarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly
as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the
narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of
the harbor to the Quai dâ€™OrlÃ©ans.

The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him
spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which
from five oâ€™clock in the morning until nine oâ€™clock at night, swarms in
the famous street of La CanebiÃ¨re,â€”a street of which the modern
PhocÃ©ens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world,
and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, â€œIf
Paris had La CanebiÃ¨re, Paris would be a second Marseilles.â€ On turning
round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders,
but in reality also watching the young sailor,â€”but there was a great
difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the
movements of Edmond DantÃ¨s.



 Chapter 2. Father and Son

We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and
endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil
suspicions against his comrade, and follow DantÃ¨s, who, after having
traversed La CanebiÃ¨re, took the Rue de Noailles, and entering a small
house, on the left of the AllÃ©es de Meilhan, rapidly ascended four
flights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while
with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused
before a half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small
room.

This room was occupied by DantÃ¨sâ€™ father. The news of the arrival of
the _Pharaon_ had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair,
was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and
sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window.
Suddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice
behind him exclaimed, â€œFatherâ€”dear father!â€

The old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he
fell into his arms, pale and trembling.

â€œWhat ails you, my dearest father? Are you ill?â€ inquired the young
man, much alarmed.

â€œNo, no, my dear Edmondâ€”my boyâ€”my son!â€”no; but I did not expect you;
and joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenlyâ€”Ah, I feel as if I were
going to die.â€

â€œCome, come, cheer up, my dear father! â€™Tis Iâ€”really I! They say joy
never hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come now, do
smile, instead of looking at me so solemnly. Here I am back again, and
we are going to be happy.â€

â€œYes, yes, my boy, so we willâ€”so we will,â€ replied the old man; â€œbut
how shall we be happy? Shall you never leave me again? Come, tell me
all the good fortune that has befallen you.â€

â€œGod forgive me,â€ said the young man, â€œfor rejoicing at happiness
derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek
this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to
lament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable
that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you
understand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred
louis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor
sailor like me could have hoped for?â€

â€œYes, my dear boy,â€ replied the old man, â€œit is very fortunate.â€

â€œWell, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a small
house, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and
honeysuckle. But what ails you, father? Are you not well?â€

â€œâ€™Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass awayâ€â€”and as he said so the
old manâ€™s strength failed him, and he fell backwards.

â€œCome, come,â€ said the young man, â€œa glass of wine, father, will revive
you. Where do you keep your wine?â€

â€œNo, no; thanks. You need not look for it; I do not want it,â€ said the
old man.

â€œYes, yes, father, tell me where it is,â€ and he opened two or three
cupboards.

â€œIt is no use,â€ said the old man, â€œthere is no wine.â€

â€œWhat, no wine?â€ said DantÃ¨s, turning pale, and looking alternately at
the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards. â€œWhat, no
wine? Have you wanted money, father?â€

â€œI want nothing now that I have you,â€ said the old man.

â€œYet,â€ stammered DantÃ¨s, wiping the perspiration from his brow,â€”â€œyet I
gave you two hundred francs when I left, three months ago.â€

â€œYes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little
debt to our neighbor, Caderousse. He reminded me of it, telling me if I
did not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see,
lest he might do you an injuryâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œWhy, I paid him.â€

â€œBut,â€ cried DantÃ¨s, â€œit was a hundred and forty francs I owed
Caderousse.â€

â€œYes,â€ stammered the old man.

â€œAnd you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?â€

The old man nodded.

â€œSo that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,â€ muttered
Edmond.

â€œYou know how little I require,â€ said the old man.

â€œHeaven pardon me,â€ cried Edmond, falling on his knees before his
father.

â€œWhat are you doing?â€

â€œYou have wounded me to the heart.â€

â€œNever mind it, for I see you once more,â€ said the old man; â€œand now
itâ€™s all overâ€”everything is all right again.â€

0035m



â€œYes, here I am,â€ said the young man, â€œwith a promising future and a
little money. Here, father, here!â€ he said, â€œtake thisâ€”take it, and
send for something immediately.â€ And he emptied his pockets on the
table, the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces, five or six
five-franc pieces, and some smaller coin. The countenance of old DantÃ¨s
brightened.

â€œWhom does this belong to?â€ he inquired.

â€œTo me, to you, to us! Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and
tomorrow we shall have more.â€

â€œGently, gently,â€ said the old man, with a smile; â€œand by your leave I
will use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy
too many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your
return, in order to be able to purchase them.â€

â€œDo as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father. I
will not have you left alone so long. I have some smuggled coffee and
most capital tobacco, in a small chest in the hold, which you shall
have tomorrow. But, hush, here comes somebody.â€

â€œâ€™Tis Caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt comes to
congratulate you on your fortunate return.â€

â€œAh, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,â€ murmured
Edmond. â€œBut, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on
a time, so heâ€™s welcome.â€

As Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at
the door. He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of
cloth, which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.

â€œWhat, is it you, Edmond, back again?â€ said he, with a broad
Marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.

â€œYes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you
in any and every way,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, but ill-concealing his coldness
under this cloak of civility.

â€œThanksâ€”thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it
chances that at times there are others who have need of me.â€ DantÃ¨s
made a gesture. â€œI do not allude to you, my boy. No!â€”no! I lent you
money, and you returned it; thatâ€™s like good neighbors, and we are
quits.â€

â€œWe are never quits with those who oblige us,â€ was DantÃ¨sâ€™ reply; â€œfor
when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let us talk
of your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a piece
of mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. â€˜You at
Marseilles?â€™â€”â€˜Yes,â€™ says he.

â€œâ€˜I thought you were at Smyrna.â€™â€”â€˜I was; but am now back again.â€™

â€œâ€˜And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?â€™

â€œâ€˜Why, with his father, no doubt,â€™ replied Danglars. And so I came,â€
added Caderousse, â€œas fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking
hands with a friend.â€

0037m



â€œWorthy Caderousse!â€ said the old man, â€œhe is so much attached to us.â€

â€œYes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks are
so rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,â€ continued the
tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which DantÃ¨s
had thrown on the table.

The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes
of his neighbor. â€œEh,â€ he said, negligently, â€œthis money is not mine. I
was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in
my absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come,
fatherâ€ added DantÃ¨s, â€œput this money back in your boxâ€”unless neighbor
Caderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.â€

â€œNo, my boy, no,â€ said Caderousse. â€œI am not in any want, thank God, my
living is suited to my means. Keep your moneyâ€”keep it, I say;â€”one never
has too much;â€”but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by
your offer as if I took advantage of it.â€

â€œIt was offered with good will,â€ said DantÃ¨s.

â€œNo doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I
hear,â€”you insinuating dog, you!â€

â€œM. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,â€ replied DantÃ¨s.

â€œThen you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.â€

â€œWhat, did you refuse to dine with him?â€ said old DantÃ¨s; â€œand did he
invite you to dine?â€

â€œYes, my dear father,â€ replied Edmond, smiling at his fatherâ€™s
astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.

â€œAnd why did you refuse, my son?â€ inquired the old man.

â€œThat I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,â€ replied the
young man. â€œI was most anxious to see you.â€

â€œBut it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,â€ said Caderousse.
â€œAnd when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy
the owner.â€

â€œBut I explained to him the cause of my refusal,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, â€œand
I hope he fully understood it.â€

â€œYes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to oneâ€™s
patrons.â€

â€œI hope to be captain without that,â€ said DantÃ¨s.

â€œSo much the betterâ€”so much the better! Nothing will give greater
pleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the
Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.â€

â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s?â€ said the old man.

â€œYes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you,
and know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent
to go and pay a visit to the Catalans.â€

â€œGo, my dear boy,â€ said old DantÃ¨s; â€œand Heaven bless you in your wife,
as it has blessed me in my son!â€

â€œHis wife!â€ said Caderousse; â€œwhy, how fast you go on, father DantÃ¨s;
she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.â€

â€œNo, but according to all probability she soon will be,â€ replied
Edmond.

â€œYesâ€”yes,â€ said Caderousse; â€œbut you were right to return as soon as
possible, my boy.â€

â€œAnd why?â€

â€œBecause MercÃ©dÃ¨s is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack
followers; she particularly has them by dozens.â€

â€œReally?â€ answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of
slight uneasiness.

0039m



â€œAh, yes,â€ continued Caderousse, â€œand capital offers, too; but you
know, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?â€

â€œMeaning to say,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, with a smile which but ill-concealed
his trouble, â€œthat if I were not a captainâ€”â€”â€

â€œEhâ€”eh!â€ said Caderousse, shaking his head.

â€œCome, come,â€ said the sailor, â€œI have a better opinion than you of
women in general, and of MercÃ©dÃ¨s in particular; and I am certain that,
captain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.â€

â€œSo much the betterâ€”so much the better,â€ said Caderousse. â€œWhen one is
going to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but
never mind that, my boy,â€”go and announce your arrival, and let her know
all your hopes and prospects.â€

â€œI will go directly,â€ was Edmondâ€™s reply; and, embracing his father,
and nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.

Caderousse lingered for a moment, then taking leave of old DantÃ¨s, he
went downstairs to rejoin Danglars, who awaited him at the corner of
the Rue Senac.

â€œWell,â€ said Danglars, â€œdid you see him?â€

â€œI have just left him,â€ answered Caderousse.

â€œDid he allude to his hope of being captain?â€

â€œHe spoke of it as a thing already decided.â€

â€œIndeed!â€ said Danglars, â€œhe is in too much hurry, it appears to me.â€

â€œWhy, it seems M. Morrel has promised him the thing.â€

â€œSo that he is quite elated about it?â€

â€œWhy, yes, he is actually insolent over the matterâ€”has already offered
me his patronage, as if he were a grand personage, and proffered me a
loan of money, as though he were a banker.â€

â€œWhich you refused?â€

â€œMost assuredly; although I might easily have accepted it, for it was I
who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned; but now M.
DantÃ¨s has no longer any occasion for assistanceâ€”he is about to become
a captain.â€

â€œPooh!â€ said Danglars, â€œhe is not one yet.â€

â€œ_Ma foi!_ it will be as well if he is not,â€ answered Caderousse; â€œfor
if he should be, there will be really no speaking to him.â€

â€œIf we choose,â€ replied Danglars, â€œhe will remain what he is; and
perhaps become even less than he is.â€

â€œWhat do you mean?â€

â€œNothingâ€”I was speaking to myself. And is he still in love with the
Catalane?â€

â€œOver head and ears; but, unless I am much mistaken, there will be a
storm in that quarter.â€

0041m



â€œExplain yourself.â€

â€œWhy should I?â€

â€œIt is more important than you think, perhaps. You do not like DantÃ¨s?â€

â€œI never like upstarts.â€

â€œThen tell me all you know about the Catalane.â€

â€œI know nothing for certain; only I have seen things which induce me to
believe, as I told you, that the future captain will find some
annoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmeries.â€

â€œWhat have you seen?â€”come, tell me!â€

â€œWell, every time I have seen MercÃ©dÃ¨s come into the city she has been
accompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red
complexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.â€

â€œReally; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?â€

â€œI only suppose so. What else can a strapping chap of twenty-one mean
with a fine wench of seventeen?â€

â€œAnd you say that DantÃ¨s has gone to the Catalans?â€

â€œHe went before I came down.â€

â€œLet us go the same way; we will stop at La RÃ©serve, and we can drink a
glass of La Malgue, whilst we wait for news.â€

â€œCome along,â€ said Caderousse; â€œbut you pay the score.â€

â€œOf course,â€ replied Danglars; and going quickly to the designated
place, they called for a bottle of wine, and two glasses.

PÃ¨re Pamphile had seen DantÃ¨s pass not ten minutes before; and assured
that he was at the Catalans, they sat down under the budding foliage of
the planes and sycamores, in the branches of which the birds were
singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring.



 Chapter 3. The Catalans

Beyond a bare, weather-worn wall, about a hundred paces from the spot
where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their
wine, was the village of the Catalans. Long ago this mysterious colony
quitted Spain, and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this
day. Whence it came no one knew, and it spoke an unknown tongue. One of
its chiefs, who understood ProvenÃ§al, begged the commune of Marseilles
to give them this bare and barren promontory, where, like the sailors
of old, they had run their boats ashore. The request was granted; and
three months afterwards, around the twelve or fifteen small vessels
which had brought these gypsies of the sea, a small village sprang up.
This village, constructed in a singular and picturesque manner, half
Moorish, half Spanish, still remains, and is inhabited by descendants
of the first comers, who speak the language of their fathers. For three
or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory, on
which they had settled like a flight of seabirds, without mixing with
the Marseillaise population, intermarrying, and preserving their
original customs and the costume of their mother-country as they have
preserved its language.

Our readers will follow us along the only street of this little
village, and enter with us one of the houses, which is sunburned to the
beautiful dead-leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country, and
within coated with whitewash, like a Spanish posada. A young and
beautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the
gazelleâ€™s, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in
her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the
flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her
arms, bare to the elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the
Arlesian Venus, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she
tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot, so as to display the
pure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton, gray and
blue clocked, stocking. At three paces from her, seated in a chair
which he balanced on two legs, leaning his elbow on an old worm-eaten
table, was a tall young man of twenty, or two-and-twenty, who was
looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were
mingled. He questioned her with his eyes, but the firm and steady gaze
of the young girl controlled his look.

â€œYou see, MercÃ©dÃ¨s,â€ said the young man, â€œhere is Easter come round
again; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?â€

â€œI have answered you a hundred times, Fernand, and really you must be
very stupid to ask me again.â€

â€œWell, repeat it,â€”repeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last believe
it! Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which had
your motherâ€™s sanction. Make me understand once for all that you are
trifling with my happiness, that my life or death are nothing to you.
Ah, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, and
to lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!â€

â€œAt least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,â€
replied MercÃ©dÃ¨s; â€œyou cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry.
I have always said to you, â€˜I love you as a brother; but do not ask
from me more than sisterly affection, for my heart is anotherâ€™s.â€™ Is
not this true, Fernand?â€

â€œYes, that is very true, MercÃ©dÃ¨s,â€ replied the young man, â€œYes, you
have been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the
Catalans a sacred law to intermarry?â€

0045m



â€œYou mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I
pray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in
the conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance,
liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier,
what would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune,
with nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable
inheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She
has been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost
entirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you,
and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and
I accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my fatherâ€™s brother,
because we were brought up together, and still more because it would
give you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this
fish which I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax
I spin,â€”I feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.â€

â€œAnd if it were, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as
well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of
Marseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful
housekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?â€

â€œFernand,â€ answered MercÃ©dÃ¨s, shaking her head, â€œa woman becomes a bad
manager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she
loves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my
friendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will
promise no more than I can bestow.â€

â€œI understand,â€ replied Fernand, â€œyou can endure your own wretchedness
patiently, but you are afraid to share mine. Well, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, beloved by
you, I would tempt fortune; you would bring me good luck, and I should
become rich. I could extend my occupation as a fisherman, might get a
place as clerk in a warehouse, and become in time a dealer myself.â€

â€œYou could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you
remain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a
fisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you
more.â€

â€œWell, I will do better, MercÃ©dÃ¨s. I will be a sailor; instead of the
costume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished hat,
a striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons.
Would not that dress please you?â€

â€œWhat do you mean?â€ asked MercÃ©dÃ¨s, with an angry glance,â€”â€œwhat do you
mean? I do not understand you?â€

â€œI mean, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me, because
you are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom you
await is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.â€

â€œFernand,â€ cried MercÃ©dÃ¨s, â€œI believed you were good-hearted, and I was
mistaken! Fernand, you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the
anger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do await, and I do love him of
whom you speak; and, if he does not return, instead of accusing him of
the inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you that he died
loving me and me only.â€ The young girl made a gesture of rage. â€œI
understand you, Fernand; you would be revenged on him because I do not
love you; you would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk. What end
would that answer? To lose you my friendship if he were conquered, and
see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor. Believe me,
to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who
loves that man. No, Fernand, you will not thus give way to evil
thoughts. Unable to have me for your wife, you will content yourself
with having me for your friend and sister; and besides,â€ she added, her
eyes troubled and moistened with tears, â€œwait, wait, Fernand; you said
just now that the sea was treacherous, and he has been gone four
months, and during these four months there have been some terrible
storms.â€

Fernand made no reply, nor did he attempt to check the tears which
flowed down the cheeks of MercÃ©dÃ¨s, although for each of these tears he
would have shed his heartâ€™s blood; but these tears flowed for another.
He arose, paced a while up and down the hut, and then, suddenly
stopping before MercÃ©dÃ¨s, with his eyes glowing and his hands
clenched,â€”â€œSay, MercÃ©dÃ¨s,â€ he said, â€œonce for all, is this your final
determination?â€

â€œI love Edmond DantÃ¨s,â€ the young girl calmly replied, â€œand none but
Edmond shall ever be my husband.â€

â€œAnd you will always love him?â€

â€œAs long as I live.â€

Fernand let fall his head like a defeated man, heaved a sigh that was
like a groan, and then suddenly looking her full in the face, with
clenched teeth and expanded nostrils, said,â€”â€œBut if he is deadâ€”â€”â€

â€œIf he is dead, I shall die too.â€

â€œIf he has forgotten youâ€”â€”â€

â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s!â€ called a joyous voice from without,â€”â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s!â€

â€œAh,â€ exclaimed the young girl, blushing with delight, and fairly
leaping in excess of love, â€œyou see he has not forgotten me, for here
he is!â€ And rushing towards the door, she opened it, saying, â€œHere,
Edmond, here I am!â€

Fernand, pale and trembling, drew back, like a traveller at the sight
of a serpent, and fell into a chair beside him. Edmond and MercÃ©dÃ¨s
were clasped in each otherâ€™s arms. The burning Marseilles sun, which
shot into the room through the open door, covered them with a flood of
light. At first they saw nothing around them. Their intense happiness
isolated them from all the rest of the world, and they only spoke in
broken words, which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem
rather the expression of sorrow. Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy, pale,
and threatening countenance of Fernand, as it was defined in the
shadow. By a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself,
the young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt.

â€œAh, your pardon,â€ said DantÃ¨s, frowning in his turn; â€œI did not
perceive that there were three of us.â€ Then, turning to MercÃ©dÃ¨s, he
inquired, â€œWho is this gentleman?â€

â€œOne who will be your best friend, DantÃ¨s, for he is my friend, my
cousin, my brother; it is Fernandâ€”the man whom, after you, Edmond, I
love the best in the world. Do you not remember him?â€

â€œYes!â€ said DantÃ¨s, and without relinquishing MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€™ hand clasped in
one of his own, he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial
air. But Fernand, instead of responding to this amiable gesture,
remained mute and trembling. Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly
at the agitated and embarrassed MercÃ©dÃ¨s, and then again on the gloomy
and menacing Fernand. This look told him all, and his anger waxed hot.

â€œI did not know, when I came with such haste to you, that I was to meet
an enemy here.â€

â€œAn enemy!â€ cried MercÃ©dÃ¨s, with an angry look at her cousin. â€œAn enemy
in my house, do you say, Edmond! If I believed that, I would place my
arm under yours and go with you to Marseilles, leaving the house to
return to it no more.â€

Fernandâ€™s eye darted lightning. â€œAnd should any misfortune occur to
you, dear Edmond,â€ she continued with the same calmness which proved to
Fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his
sinister thought, â€œif misfortune should occur to you, I would ascend
the highest point of the Cape de Morgiou and cast myself headlong from
it.â€

Fernand became deadly pale. â€œBut you are deceived, Edmond,â€ she
continued. â€œYou have no enemy hereâ€”there is no one but Fernand, my
brother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.â€

And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the
Catalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and
offered him his hand. His hatred, like a powerless though furious wave,
was broken against the strong ascendancy which MercÃ©dÃ¨s exercised over
him. Scarcely, however, had he touched Edmondâ€™s hand when he felt he
had done all he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house.

â€œOh,â€ he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hairâ€”â€œOh, who
will deliver me from this man? Wretchedâ€”wretched that I am!â€

â€œHallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running to?â€ exclaimed a
voice.

The young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived
Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars, under an arbor.

â€œWellâ€, said Caderousse, â€œwhy donâ€™t you come? Are you really in such a
hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?â€

â€œParticularly when they have still a full bottle before them,â€ added
Danglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not
say a word.

â€œHe seems besotted,â€ said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee.
â€œAre we mistaken, and is DantÃ¨s triumphant in spite of all we have
believed?â€

â€œWhy, we must inquire into that,â€ was Caderousseâ€™s reply; and turning
towards the young man, said, â€œWell, Catalan, canâ€™t you make up your
mind?â€

Fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly
entered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness
to his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his
exhausted body.

â€œGood-day,â€ said he. â€œYou called me, didnâ€™t you?â€ And he fell, rather
than sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.

â€œI called you because you were running like a madman, and I was afraid
you would throw yourself into the sea,â€ said Caderousse, laughing.
â€œWhy, when a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of
wine, but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of
water unnecessarily!â€

Fernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into
his hands, his elbows leaning on the table.

â€œWell, Fernand, I must say,â€ said Caderousse, beginning the
conversation, with that brutality of the common people in which
curiosity destroys all diplomacy, â€œyou look uncommonly like a rejected
lover;â€ and he burst into a hoarse laugh.

â€œBah!â€ said Danglars, â€œa lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in
love. You are laughing at him, Caderousse.â€

â€œNo,â€ he replied, â€œonly hark how he sighs! Come, come, Fernand,â€ said
Caderousse, â€œhold up your head, and answer us. Itâ€™s not polite not to
reply to friends who ask news of your health.â€

â€œMy health is well enough,â€ said Fernand, clenching his hands without
raising his head.

â€œAh, you see, Danglars,â€ said Caderousse, winking at his friend, â€œthis
is how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan,
one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very
fine girl, named MercÃ©dÃ¨s; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine
girl is in love with the mate of the _Pharaon_; and as the _Pharaon_
arrived todayâ€”why, you understand!â€

â€œNo; I do not understand,â€ said Danglars.

â€œPoor Fernand has been dismissed,â€ continued Caderousse.

â€œWell, and what then?â€ said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking
at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his
anger; â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not
free to love whomsoever she will?â€

â€œOh, if you take it in that sense,â€ said Caderousse, â€œit is another
thing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans
were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It was
even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.â€

Fernand smiled piteously. â€œA lover is never terrible,â€ he said.

â€œPoor fellow!â€ remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from
the bottom of his heart. â€œWhy, you see, he did not expect to see DantÃ¨s
return so suddenlyâ€”he thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance
faithless! These things always come on us more severely when they come
suddenly.â€

â€œAh, _ma foi_, under any circumstances!â€ said Caderousse, who drank as
he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take
effect,â€”â€œunder any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out
by the fortunate arrival of DantÃ¨s; is he, Danglars?â€

â€œNo, you are rightâ€”and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.â€

â€œWell, never mind,â€ answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine
for Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while
Danglars had merely sipped his. â€œNever mindâ€”in the meantime he marries
MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€”the lovely MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€”at least he returns to do that.â€

During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man,
on whose heart Caderousseâ€™s words fell like molten lead.

â€œAnd when is the wedding to be?â€ he asked.

â€œOh, it is not yet fixed!â€ murmured Fernand.

â€œNo, but it will be,â€ said Caderousse, â€œas surely as DantÃ¨s will be
captain of the _Pharaon_â€”eh, Danglars?â€

Danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse,
whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow
was premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already
rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.

â€œWell,â€ said he, filling the glasses, â€œlet us drink to Captain Edmond
DantÃ¨s, husband of the beautiful Catalane!â€

Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and
swallowed the contents at a gulp. Fernand dashed his on the ground.

â€œEh, eh, eh!â€ stammered Caderousse. â€œWhat do I see down there by the
wall, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, your eyes are
better than mine. I believe I see double. You know wine is a deceiver;
but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and hand in
hand. Heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them, and
they are actually embracing!â€

Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.

â€œDo you know them, Fernand?â€ he said.

â€œYes,â€ was the reply, in a low voice. â€œIt is Edmond and MercÃ©dÃ¨s!â€

â€œAh, see there, now!â€ said Caderousse; â€œand I did not recognize them!
Hallo, DantÃ¨s! hello, lovely damsel! Come this way, and let us know
when the wedding is to be, for Fernand here is so obstinate he will not
tell us.â€

â€œHold your tongue, will you?â€ said Danglars, pretending to restrain
Caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the
arbor. â€œTry to stand upright, and let the lovers make love without
interruption. See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is
well-behaved!â€

0051m



Fernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the
bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen
from his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong
upon his rival, when MercÃ©dÃ¨s, smiling and graceful, lifted up her
lovely head, and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes. At this
Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped
again heavily on his seat. Danglars looked at the two men, one after
the other, the one brutalized by liquor, the other overwhelmed with
love.

â€œI shall get nothing from these fools,â€ he muttered; â€œand I am very
much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward. Hereâ€™s an
envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing
his wrath, and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from
under his nose and takes on like a big baby. Yet this Catalan has eyes
that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards, Sicilians, and
Calabrians, and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one
blow. Unquestionably, Edmondâ€™s star is in the ascendant, and he will
marry the splendid girlâ€”he will be captain, too, and laugh at us all,
unlessâ€â€”a sinister smile passed over Danglarsâ€™ lipsâ€”â€œunless I take a
hand in the affair,â€ he added.

â€œHallo!â€ continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the
table, â€œhallo, Edmond! do you not see your friends, or are you too
proud to speak to them?â€

â€œNo, my dear fellow!â€ replied DantÃ¨s, â€œI am not proud, but I am happy,
and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.â€

â€œAh, very well, thatâ€™s an explanation!â€ said Caderousse. â€œHow do you
do, Madame DantÃ¨s?â€

MercÃ©dÃ¨s courtesied gravely, and saidâ€”â€œThat is not my name, and in my
country it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young girl by the
name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband. So call me
MercÃ©dÃ¨s, if you please.â€

â€œWe must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,â€ said DantÃ¨s, â€œhe is
so easily mistaken.â€

â€œSo, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M. DantÃ¨s,â€ said
Danglars, bowing to the young couple.

â€œAs soon as possible, M. Danglars; today all preliminaries will be
arranged at my fatherâ€™s, and tomorrow, or next day at latest, the
wedding festival here at La RÃ©serve. My friends will be there, I hope;
that is to say, you are invited, M. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.â€

â€œAnd Fernand,â€ said Caderousse with a chuckle; â€œFernand, too, is
invited!â€

â€œMy wifeâ€™s brother is my brother,â€ said Edmond; â€œand we, MercÃ©dÃ¨s and
I, should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.â€

Fernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice died on his lips, and
he could not utter a word.

â€œToday the preliminaries, tomorrow or next day the ceremony! You are in
a hurry, captain!â€

â€œDanglars,â€ said Edmond, smiling, â€œI will say to you as MercÃ©dÃ¨s said
just now to Caderousse, â€˜Do not give me a title which does not belong
to meâ€™; that may bring me bad luck.â€

â€œYour pardon,â€ replied Danglars, â€œI merely said you seemed in a hurry,
and we have lots of time; the _Pharaon_ cannot be under weigh again in
less than three months.â€

â€œWe are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have
suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good
fortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I
must go to Paris.â€

â€œAh, really?â€”to Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been
there, DantÃ¨s?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œHave you business there?â€

â€œNot of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you know
to what I allude, Danglarsâ€”it is sacred. Besides, I shall only take the
time to go and return.â€

â€œYes, yes, I understand,â€ said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he
added, â€œTo Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand
marshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an ideaâ€”a capital idea! Ah;
DantÃ¨s, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the
good ship _Pharaon_;â€ then turning towards Edmond, who was walking
away, â€œA pleasant journey,â€ he cried.

â€œThank you,â€ said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers
continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very
elect of heaven.



 Chapter 4. Conspiracy

Danglars followed Edmond and MercÃ©dÃ¨s with his eyes until the two
lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas;
then, turning round, he perceived Fernand, who had fallen, pale and
trembling, into his chair, while Caderousse stammered out the words of
a drinking-song.

â€œWell, my dear sir,â€ said Danglars to Fernand, â€œhere is a marriage
which does not appear to make everybody happy.â€

â€œIt drives me to despair,â€ said Fernand.

â€œDo you, then, love MercÃ©dÃ¨s?â€

â€œI adore her!â€

â€œFor long?â€

â€œAs long as I have known herâ€”always.â€

â€œAnd you sit there, tearing your hair, instead of seeking to remedy
your condition; I did not think that was the way of your people.â€

â€œWhat would you have me do?â€ said Fernand.

â€œHow do I know? Is it my affair? I am not in love with Mademoiselle
MercÃ©dÃ¨s; but for youâ€”in the words of the gospel, seek, and you shall
find.â€

â€œI have found already.â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œI would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune
happened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.â€

â€œPooh! Women say those things, but never do them.â€

â€œYou do not know MercÃ©dÃ¨s; what she threatens she will do.â€

â€œIdiot!â€ muttered Danglars; â€œwhether she kill herself or not, what
matter, provided DantÃ¨s is not captain?â€

â€œBefore MercÃ©dÃ¨s should die,â€ replied Fernand, with the accents of
unshaken resolution, â€œI would die myself!â€

â€œThatâ€™s what I call love!â€ said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than
ever. â€œThatâ€™s love, or I donâ€™t know what love is.â€

â€œCome,â€ said Danglars, â€œyou appear to me a good sort of fellow, and
hang me, I should like to help you, butâ€”â€”â€

â€œYes,â€ said Caderousse, â€œbut how?â€

â€œMy dear fellow,â€ replied Danglars, â€œyou are three parts drunk; finish
the bottle, and you will be completely so. Drink then, and do not
meddle with what we are discussing, for that requires all oneâ€™s wit and
cool judgment.â€

â€œIâ€”drunk!â€ said Caderousse; â€œwell thatâ€™s a good one! I could drink four
more such bottles; they are no bigger than cologne flasks. PÃ¨re
Pamphile, more wine!â€

And Caderousse rattled his glass upon the table.

â€œYou were saying, sirâ€”â€”â€ said Fernand, awaiting with great anxiety the
end of this interrupted remark.

â€œWhat was I saying? I forget. This drunken Caderousse has made me lose
the thread of my sentence.â€

â€œDrunk, if you like; so much the worse for those who fear wine, for it
is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will
extract from their hearts;â€ and Caderousse began to sing the two last
lines of a song very popular at the time:

â€˜Tous les mÃ©chants sont buveurs dâ€™eau;

Câ€™est bien prouvÃ© par le dÃ©luge.â€™1


â€œYou said, sir, you would like to help me, butâ€”â€”â€

â€œYes; but I added, to help you it would be sufficient that DantÃ¨s did
not marry her you love; and the marriage may easily be thwarted,
methinks, and yet DantÃ¨s need not die.â€

â€œDeath alone can separate them,â€ remarked Fernand.

â€œYou talk like a noodle, my friend,â€ said Caderousse; â€œand here is
Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to
you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you.
Say there is no need why DantÃ¨s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity
he should. DantÃ¨s is a good fellow; I like DantÃ¨s. DantÃ¨s, your
health.â€

Fernand rose impatiently. â€œLet him run on,â€ said Danglars, restraining
the young man; â€œdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says.
Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were
between Edmond and MercÃ©dÃ¨s they would be as effectually separated as
if he lay under a tombstone.â€

0056m



â€œYes; but one gets out of prison,â€ said Caderousse, who, with what
sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, â€œand when one
gets out and oneâ€™s name is Edmond DantÃ¨s, one seeks revengeâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat matters that?â€ muttered Fernand.

â€œAnd why, I should like to know,â€ persisted Caderousse, â€œshould they
put DantÃ¨s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.â€

â€œHold your tongue!â€ said Danglars.

â€œI wonâ€™t hold my tongue!â€ replied Caderousse; â€œI say I want to know why
they should put DantÃ¨s in prison; I like DantÃ¨s; DantÃ¨s, your health!â€
and he swallowed another glass of wine.

0057m



Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his
intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, â€œWell, you understand
there is no need to kill him.â€

â€œCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having
DantÃ¨s arrested. Have you that means?â€

â€œIt is to be found for the searching. But why should I meddle in the
matter? it is no affair of mine.â€

â€œI know not why you meddle,â€ said Fernand, seizing his arm; â€œbut this I
know, you have some motive of personal hatred against DantÃ¨s, for he
who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others.â€

â€œI! motives of hatred against DantÃ¨s? None, on my word! I saw you were
unhappy, and your unhappiness interested me; thatâ€™s all; but since you
believe I act for my own account, adieu, my dear friend, get out of the
affair as best you may;â€ and Danglars rose as if he meant to depart.

â€œNo, no,â€ said Fernand, restraining him, â€œstay! It is of very little
consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry
feeling or not against DantÃ¨s. I hate him! I confess it openly. Do you
find the means, I will execute it, provided it is not to kill the man,
for MercÃ©dÃ¨s has declared she will kill herself if DantÃ¨s is killed.â€

Caderousse, who had let his head drop on the table, now raised it, and
looking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes, he said, â€œKill DantÃ¨s!
who talks of killing DantÃ¨s? I wonâ€™t have him killedâ€”I wonâ€™t! Heâ€™s my
friend, and this morning offered to share his money with me, as I
shared mine with him. I wonâ€™t have DantÃ¨s killedâ€”I wonâ€™t!â€

â€œAnd who has said a word about killing him, muddlehead?â€ replied
Danglars. â€œWe were merely joking; drink to his health,â€ he added,
filling Caderousseâ€™s glass, â€œand do not interfere with us.â€

â€œYes, yes, DantÃ¨sâ€™ good health!â€ said Caderousse, emptying his glass,
â€œhereâ€™s to his health! his healthâ€”hurrah!â€

â€œBut the meansâ€”the means?â€ said Fernand.

â€œHave you not hit upon any?â€ asked Danglars.

â€œNo!â€”you undertook to do so.â€

â€œTrue,â€ replied Danglars; â€œthe French have the superiority over the
Spaniards, that the Spaniards ruminate, while the French invent.â€

â€œDo you invent, then,â€ said Fernand impatiently.

â€œWaiter,â€ said Danglars, â€œpen, ink, and paper.â€

â€œPen, ink, and paper,â€ muttered Fernand.

â€œYes; I am a supercargo; pen, ink, and paper are my tools, and without
my tools I am fit for nothing.â€

â€œPen, ink, and paper, then,â€ called Fernand loudly.

â€œThereâ€™s what you want on that table,â€ said the waiter.

â€œBring them here.â€ The waiter did as he was desired.

0059m



â€œWhen one thinks,â€ said Caderousse, letting his hand drop on the paper,
â€œthere is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at
the corner of a wood to assassinate him! I have always had more dread
of a pen, a bottle of ink, and a sheet of paper, than of a sword or
pistol.â€

â€œThe fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be,â€ said Danglars. â€œGive
him some more wine, Fernand.â€ Fernand filled Caderousseâ€™s glass, who,
like the confirmed toper he was, lifted his hand from the paper and
seized the glass.

The Catalan watched him until Caderousse, almost overcome by this fresh
assault on his senses, rested, or rather dropped, his glass upon the
table.

â€œWell!â€ resumed the Catalan, as he saw the final glimmer of
Caderousseâ€™s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine.

â€œWell, then, I should say, for instance,â€ resumed Danglars, â€œthat if
after a voyage such as DantÃ¨s has just made, in which he touched at the
Island of Elba, someone were to denounce him to the kingâ€™s procureur as
a Bonapartist agentâ€”â€”â€

â€œI will denounce him!â€ exclaimed the young man hastily.

â€œYes, but they will make you then sign your declaration, and confront
you with him you have denounced; I will supply you with the means of
supporting your accusation, for I know the fact well. But DantÃ¨s cannot
remain forever in prison, and one day or other he will leave it, and
the day when he comes out, woe betide him who was the cause of his
incarceration!â€

â€œOh, I should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a
quarrel with me.â€

â€œYes, and MercÃ©dÃ¨s! MercÃ©dÃ¨s, who will detest you if you have only the
misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond!â€

â€œTrue!â€ said Fernand.

â€œNo, no,â€ continued Danglars; â€œif we resolve on such a step, it would
be much better to take, as I now do, this pen, dip it into this ink,
and write with the left hand (that the writing may not be recognized)
the denunciation we propose.â€ And Danglars, uniting practice with
theory, wrote with his left hand, and in a writing reversed from his
usual style, and totally unlike it, the following lines, which he
handed to Fernand, and which Fernand read in an undertone:

â€œThe honorable, the kingâ€™s attorney, is informed by a friend of the
throne and religion, that one Edmond DantÃ¨s, mate of the ship
_Pharaon_, arrived this morning from Smyrna, after having touched at
Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a letter for
the usurper, and by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist
committee in Paris. Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him,
for the letter will be found upon him, or at his fatherâ€™s, or in his
cabin on board the _Pharaon_.â€

â€œVery good,â€ resumed Danglars; â€œnow your revenge looks like common
sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter will
thus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter
as I am doing, and write upon it, â€˜To the kingâ€™s attorney,â€™ and thatâ€™s
all settled.â€ And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke.

â€œYes, and thatâ€™s all settled!â€ exclaimed Caderousse, who, by a last
effort of intellect, had followed the reading of the letter, and
instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation
must entail. â€œYes, and thatâ€™s all settled; only it will be an infamous
shame;â€ and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter.

â€œYes,â€ said Danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; â€œand as what I
say and do is merely in jest, and I, amongst the first and foremost,
should be sorry if anything happened to DantÃ¨sâ€”the worthy DantÃ¨sâ€”look
here!â€ And taking the letter, he squeezed it up in his hands and threw
it into a corner of the arbor.

â€œAll right!â€ said Caderousse. â€œDantÃ¨s is my friend, and I wonâ€™t have
him ill-used.â€

â€œAnd who thinks of using him ill? Certainly neither I nor Fernand,â€
said Danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained
seated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper
flung into the corner.

â€œIn this case,â€ replied Caderousse, â€œletâ€™s have some more wine. I wish
to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely MercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œYou have had too much already, drunkard,â€ said Danglars; â€œand if you
continue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because unable to stand
on your legs.â€

â€œI?â€ said Caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken
man, â€œI canâ€™t keep on my legs? Why, Iâ€™ll wager I can go up into the
belfry of the Accoules, and without staggering, too!â€

â€œDone!â€ said Danglars, â€œIâ€™ll take your bet; but tomorrowâ€”today it is
time to return. Give me your arm, and let us go.â€

â€œVery well, let us go,â€ said Caderousse; â€œbut I donâ€™t want your arm at
all. Come, Fernand, wonâ€™t you return to Marseilles with us?â€

â€œNo,â€ said Fernand; â€œI shall return to the Catalans.â€

â€œYouâ€™re wrong. Come with us to Marseillesâ€”come along.â€

â€œI will not.â€

â€œWhat do you mean? you will not? Well, just as you like, my prince;
thereâ€™s liberty for all the world. Come along, Danglars, and let the
young gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses.â€

Danglars took advantage of Caderousseâ€™s temper at the moment, to take
him off towards Marseilles by the Porte Saint-Victor, staggering as he
went.

When they had advanced about twenty yards, Danglars looked back and saw
Fernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his
pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon.

â€œWell,â€ said Caderousse, â€œwhy, what a lie he told! He said he was going
to the Catalans, and he is going to the city. Hallo, Fernand! You are
coming, my boy!â€

â€œOh, you donâ€™t see straight,â€ said Danglars; â€œheâ€™s gone right by the
road to the Vieilles Infirmeries.â€

â€œWell,â€ said Caderousse, â€œI should have sworn that he turned to the
rightâ€”how treacherous wine is!â€

â€œCome, come,â€ said Danglars to himself, â€œnow the thing is at work and
it will effect its purpose unassisted.â€



 Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast

The morningâ€™s sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves
into a network of ruby-tinted light.

The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La RÃ©serve, with
whose arbor the reader is already familiar. The apartment destined for
the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows, over each
of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the
name of one of the principal cities of France; beneath these windows a
wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house. And although
the entertainment was fixed for twelve oâ€™clock, an hour previous to
that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests,
consisting of the favored part of the crew of the _Pharaon_, and other
personal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed
themselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to
the occasion.

Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the
_Pharaon_ had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed
unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding
condescension could possibly be intended.

Danglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by
Caderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had
recently conversed with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his
intention to dine at La RÃ©serve.

In fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an
enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _Pharaon_, who
hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man
whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first
in command of the ship; and as DantÃ¨s was universally beloved on board
his vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at
finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly
coincided with their own.

With the entrance of M. Morrel, Danglars and Caderousse were despatched
in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the
arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a
lively sensation, and to beseech him to make haste.

Danglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but
ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards
them, composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in
attendance on the bride, by whose side walked DantÃ¨sâ€™ father; the whole
brought up by Fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.

Neither MercÃ©dÃ¨s nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his
countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the
sunshine and the presence of each other.

Having acquitted themselves of their errand, and exchanged a hearty
shake of the hand with Edmond, Danglars and Caderousse took their
places beside Fernand and old DantÃ¨s,â€”the latter of whom attracted
universal notice.

The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk, trimmed
with steel buttons, beautifully cut and polished. His thin but wiry
legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings,
evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat
depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. Thus he came
along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged
countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one
of the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the
Luxembourg and Tuileries.

Beside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to partake of the good
things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become
reconciled to the DantÃ¨s, father and son, although there still lingered
in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the
preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the
dim and misty outline of a dream.

0065m



As Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of
deep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair,
who seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten
that such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted;
occasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance,
and a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated
and restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like
one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.

DantÃ¨s himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar
to the merchant serviceâ€”a costume somewhat between a military and a
civil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and
happiness, a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be
imagined.

Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, MercÃ©dÃ¨s boasted the same
bright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved
with the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more
practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes
beneath a veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed
lashes, so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes;
but, on the contrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile
that seemed to say: â€œIf you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am
very happy.â€

As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La RÃ©serve, M. Morrel
descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and
sailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already
given, that DantÃ¨s should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere.
Edmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of
his affianced bride within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting
her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the
feast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose
heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of
several minutes.

â€œFather,â€ said MercÃ©dÃ¨s, stopping when she had reached the centre of
the table, â€œsit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left I will place
him who has ever been as a brother to me,â€ pointing with a soft and
gentle smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the
direst torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even
beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen
retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.

During this time, DantÃ¨s, at the opposite side of the table, had been
occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was
seated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from
Edmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most
agreeable.

Then they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages,
and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and
brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel
within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than
rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, North. All the
delicacies, in fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the
sandy beach, and styled by the grateful fishermen â€œfruits of the sea.â€

â€œA pretty silence truly!â€ said the old father of the bridegroom, as he
carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the
topaz, and which had just been placed before MercÃ©dÃ¨s herself. â€œNow,
would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who
desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?â€

â€œAh,â€ sighed Caderousse, â€œa man cannot always feel happy because he is
about to be married.â€

â€œThe truth is,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, â€œthat I am too happy for noisy mirth;
if that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you
are right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us
almost the same as sorrow.â€

Danglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and
betrayed each fresh impression.

â€œWhy, what ails you?â€ asked he of Edmond. â€œDo you fear any approaching
evil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this
instant.â€

â€œAnd that is the very thing that alarms me,â€ returned DantÃ¨s. â€œMan does
not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness
is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where
fierce, fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of
all shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. I
own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of
which I feel myself unworthyâ€”that of being the husband of MercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œNay, nay!â€ cried Caderousse, smiling, â€œyou have not attained that
honor yet. MercÃ©dÃ¨s is not yet your wife. Just assume the tone and
manner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is
not yet come!â€

The bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start
at every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops
of perspiration that gathered on his brow.

â€œWell, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to
contradict me for such a trifle as that. â€™Tis true that MercÃ©dÃ¨s is not
actually my wife; but,â€ added he, drawing out his watch, â€œin an hour
and a half she will be.â€

A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the
exception of the elder DantÃ¨s, whose laugh displayed the still perfect
beauty of his large white teeth. MercÃ©dÃ¨s looked pleased and gratified,
while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.

â€œIn an hour?â€ inquired Danglars, turning pale. â€œHow is that, my
friend?â€

â€œWhy, thus it is,â€ replied DantÃ¨s. â€œThanks to the influence of M.
Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every
difficulty has been removed. We have purchased permission to waive the
usual delay; and at half-past two oâ€™clock the Mayor of Marseilles will
be waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past one has
already struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying,
that, in another hour and thirty minutes MercÃ©dÃ¨s will have become
Madame DantÃ¨s.â€

0069m



Fernand closed his eyes, a burning sensation passed across his brow,
and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his
falling from his chair; but in spite of all his efforts, he could not
refrain from uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the
noisy felicitations of the company.

â€œUpon my word,â€ cried the old man, â€œyou make short work of this kind of
affair. Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married today at three
oâ€™clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!â€

â€œBut,â€ asked Danglars, in a timid tone, â€œhow did you manage about the
other formalitiesâ€”the contractâ€”the settlement?â€

â€œThe contract,â€ answered DantÃ¨s, laughingly, â€œit didnâ€™t take long to
fix that. MercÃ©dÃ¨s has no fortune; I have none to settle on her. So,
you see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come
very expensive.â€ This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.

â€œSo that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to
be the actual wedding dinner!â€ said Danglars.

â€œNo, no,â€ answered DantÃ¨s; â€œdonâ€™t imagine I am going to put you off in
that shabby manner. Tomorrow morning I start for Paris; four days to
go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission
entrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall be back
here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage
feast.â€

This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests
to such a degree, that the elder DantÃ¨s, who, at the commencement of
the repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it
difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a momentâ€™s
tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the
bride and bridegroom.

DantÃ¨s, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded
by a look of grateful pleasure; while MercÃ©dÃ¨s glanced at the clock and
made an expressive gesture to Edmond.

Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at
such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social
position not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at the
commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves
according to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out
more agreeable companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting
for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or
her own thoughts.

Fernandâ€™s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars. As
for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the
damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and,
as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such
deafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther
end of the salon.

Caderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most
anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.

â€œUpon my word,â€ said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment
of DantÃ¨s, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken
of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at DantÃ¨sâ€™ good
fortune,â€”â€œupon my word, DantÃ¨s is a downright good fellow, and when I
see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. I
cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him
that trick you were planning yesterday.â€

â€œOh, there was no harm meant,â€ answered Danglars; â€œat first I certainly
did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do; but
when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as
to become one of his rivalâ€™s attendants, I knew there was no further
cause for apprehension.â€ Caderousse looked full at Fernandâ€”he was
ghastly pale.

â€œCertainly,â€ continued Danglars, â€œthe sacrifice was no trifling one,
when the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul, that future
captain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad! I only wish he would let me take
his place.â€

â€œShall we not set forth?â€ asked the sweet, silvery voice of MercÃ©dÃ¨s;
â€œtwo oâ€™clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter
of an hour.â€

0071m



â€œTo be sure!â€”to be sure!â€ cried DantÃ¨s, eagerly quitting the table;
â€œlet us go directly!â€

His words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.

At this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every
change in Fernandâ€™s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back,
with an almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the
open windows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct
sound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with
the clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and
buzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the
bridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension
quelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most
deathlike stillness prevailed.

The sounds drew nearer. Three blows were struck upon the panel of the
door. The company looked at each other in consternation.

â€œI demand admittance,â€ said a loud voice outside the room, â€œin the name
of the law!â€ As no attempt was made to prevent it, the door was opened,
and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, presented himself,
followed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness now yielded to the
most extreme dread on the part of those present.

â€œMay I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?â€ said M.
Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; â€œthere is
doubtless some mistake easily explained.â€

â€œIf it be so,â€ replied the magistrate, â€œrely upon every reparation
being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and
although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must,
nevertheless, be fulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled
answers to the name of Edmond DantÃ¨s?â€

Every eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation
he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm
voice:

â€œI am he; what is your pleasure with me?â€

â€œEdmond DantÃ¨s,â€ replied the magistrate, â€œI arrest you in the name of
the law!â€

â€œMe!â€ repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, â€œand wherefore, I
pray?â€

â€œI cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons
that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary
examination.â€

M. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He
saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly
well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate
decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold
marble effigy. Old DantÃ¨s, however, sprang forward. There are
situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to
understand. He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the
officer was touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said,
â€œMy worthy friend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your
son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in
registering his cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at
liberty directly he has given the information required, whether
touching the health of his crew, or the value of his freight.â€

â€œWhat is the meaning of all this?â€ inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of
Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.

0073m



â€œHow can I tell you?â€ replied he; â€œI am, like yourself, utterly
bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out
what it is about.â€ Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he
had disappeared.

The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with
startling clearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed
appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication
of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory.

â€œSo, so,â€ said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, â€œthis,
then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday?
All I can say is, that if it be so, â€™tis an ill turn, and well deserves
to bring double evil on those who have projected it.â€

â€œNonsense,â€ returned Danglars, â€œI tell you again I have nothing
whatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the
paper to pieces.â€

â€œNo, you did not!â€ answered Caderousse, â€œyou merely threw it byâ€”I saw
it lying in a corner.â€

â€œHold your tongue, you fool!â€”what should you know about it?â€”why, you
were drunk!â€

â€œWhere is Fernand?â€ inquired Caderousse.

â€œHow do I know?â€ replied Danglars; â€œgone, as every prudent man ought to
be, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never mind where he is,
let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.â€

During this conversation, DantÃ¨s, after having exchanged a cheerful
shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered
himself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, â€œMake
yourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to
clear up, thatâ€™s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to
go so far as the prison to effect that.â€

0075m



â€œOh, to be sure!â€ responded Danglars, who had now approached the group,
â€œnothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.â€

DantÃ¨s descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and
followed by the soldiers. A carriage awaited him at the door; he got
in, followed by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove
off towards Marseilles.

â€œAdieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!â€ cried MercÃ©dÃ¨s, stretching out her arms
to him from the balcony.

The prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken
heart, and leaning from the coach he called out, â€œGood-bye, MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€”we
shall soon meet again!â€ Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the
turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.

â€œWait for me here, all of you!â€ cried M. Morrel; â€œI will take the first
conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you
word how all is going on.â€

â€œThatâ€™s right!â€ exclaimed a multitude of voices, â€œgo, and return as
quickly as you can!â€

This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of
terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old
father and MercÃ©dÃ¨s remained for some time apart, each absorbed in
grief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their
eyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each otherâ€™s
arms.

Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass
of water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit
down at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed
next to the seat on which poor MercÃ©dÃ¨s had fallen half fainting, when
released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old DantÃ¨s.
Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair.

â€œHe is the cause of all this miseryâ€”I am quite sure of it,â€ whispered
Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars.

â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ answered the other; â€œheâ€™s too stupid to imagine
such a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of
whoever wrought it.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,â€ said
Caderousse.

â€œSurely,â€ answered Danglars, â€œone cannot be held responsible for every
chance arrow shot into the air.â€

â€œYou can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebodyâ€™s
head.â€

Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every
different form.

â€œWhat think you, Danglars,â€ said one of the party, turning towards him,
â€œof this event?â€

â€œWhy,â€ replied he, â€œI think it just possible DantÃ¨s may have been
detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as
contraband.â€

â€œBut how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since
you are the shipâ€™s supercargo?â€

â€œWhy, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the
merchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with
cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastretâ€™s
warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascalâ€™s; that is all I was obliged to
know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.â€

â€œNow I recollect,â€ said the afflicted old father; â€œmy poor boy told me
yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for
me!â€

â€œThere, you see,â€ exclaimed Danglars. â€œNow the mischief is out; depend
upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our
absence, and discovered poor DantÃ¨sâ€™ hidden treasures.â€

MercÃ©dÃ¨s, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her loverâ€™s
arrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst
out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.

â€œCome, come,â€ said the old man, â€œbe comforted, my poor child; there is
still hope!â€

â€œHope!â€ repeated Danglars.

â€œHope!â€ faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on
his pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his
countenance.

â€œGood news! good news!â€ shouted forth one of the party stationed in the
balcony on the lookout. â€œHere comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, now, we
shall hear that our friend is released!â€

MercÃ©dÃ¨s and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him
at the door. He was very pale.

â€œWhat news?â€ exclaimed a general burst of voices.

â€œAlas, my friends,â€ replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his
head, â€œthe thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected.â€

â€œOh, indeedâ€”indeed, sir, he is innocent!â€ sobbed forth MercÃ©dÃ¨s.

â€œThat I believe!â€ answered M. Morrel; â€œbut still he is chargedâ€”â€”â€

â€œWith what?â€ inquired the elder DantÃ¨s.

â€œWith being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!â€ Many of our readers
may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in
the period at which our story is dated.

A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of MercÃ©dÃ¨s; the old man sank
into a chair.

â€œAh, Danglars!â€ whispered Caderousse, â€œyou have deceived meâ€”the trick
you spoke of last night has been played; but I cannot suffer a poor old
man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault. I am
determined to tell them all about it.â€

â€œBe silent, you simpleton!â€ cried Danglars, grasping him by the arm,
â€œor I will not answer even for your own safety. Who can tell whether
DantÃ¨s be innocent or guilty? The vessel did touch at Elba, where he
quitted it, and passed a whole day in the island. Now, should any
letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon
him, will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his
accomplices?â€

With the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived
the solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully,
wistfully, on Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.

â€œSuppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,â€ said he, casting a
bewildered look on his companion.

â€œTo be sure!â€ answered Danglars. â€œLet us wait, by all means. If he be
innocent, of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty, why, it is no
use involving ourselves in a conspiracy.â€

â€œLet us go, then. I cannot stay here any longer.â€

â€œWith all my heart!â€ replied Danglars, pleased to find the other so
tractable. â€œLet us take ourselves out of the way, and leave things for
the present to take their course.â€

After their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and
protector of MercÃ©dÃ¨s, led the girl to her home, while some friends of
DantÃ¨s conducted his father, nearly lifeless, to the AllÃ©es de Meilhan.

The rumor of Edmondâ€™s arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in
circulating throughout the city.

â€œCould you ever have credited such a thing, my dear Danglars?â€ asked M.
Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh
tidings of DantÃ¨s, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he
overtook his supercargo and Caderousse. â€œCould you have believed such a
thing possible?â€

â€œWhy, you know I told you,â€ replied Danglars, â€œthat I considered the
circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very
suspicious circumstance.â€

â€œAnd did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?â€

0079m



â€œCertainly not!â€ returned Danglars. Then added in a low whisper, â€œYou
understand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who
served under the _other_ government, and who does not altogether
conceal what he thinks on the subject, you are strongly suspected of
regretting the abdication of Napoleon. I should have feared to injure
both Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a
soul. I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is
bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are
many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.â€

â€œâ€™Tis well, Danglarsâ€”â€™tis well!â€ replied M. Morrel. â€œYou are a worthy
fellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of
poor Edmond having become captain of the _Pharaon_.â€

â€œIs it possible you were so kind?â€

â€œYes, indeed; I had previously inquired of DantÃ¨s what was his opinion
of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your
post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.â€

â€œAnd what was his reply?â€

â€œThat he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair
which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that
whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the shipâ€™s owners
would have his preference also.â€

â€œThe hypocrite!â€ murmured Danglars.

â€œPoor DantÃ¨s!â€ said Caderousse. â€œNo one can deny his being a
noble-hearted young fellow.â€

â€œBut meanwhile,â€ continued M. Morrel, â€œhere is the _Pharaon_ without a
captain.â€

â€œOh,â€ replied Danglars, â€œsince we cannot leave this port for the next
three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period DantÃ¨s
will be set at liberty.â€

â€œNo doubt; but in the meantime?â€

â€œI am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,â€ answered Danglars. â€œYou
know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced
captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to
accept my services, that upon Edmondâ€™s release from prison no further
change will be requisite on board the _Pharaon_ than for DantÃ¨s and
myself each to resume our respective posts.â€

â€œThanks, Danglarsâ€”that will smooth over all difficulties. I fully
authorize you at once to assume the command of the _Pharaon_, and look
carefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes must
never be allowed to interfere with business.â€

â€œBe easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be
permitted to see our poor Edmond?â€

â€œI will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I
shall endeavor to interest in Edmondâ€™s favor. I am aware he is a
furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being kingâ€™s
attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of
one.â€

â€œPerhaps not,â€ replied Danglars; â€œbut I hear that he is ambitious, and
thatâ€™s rather against him.â€

â€œWell, well,â€ returned M. Morrel, â€œwe shall see. But now hasten on
board, I will join you there ere long.â€

So saying, the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies, and proceeded
in the direction of the Palais de Justice.

0081m



â€œYou see,â€ said Danglars, addressing Caderousse, â€œthe turn things have
taken. Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?â€

â€œNot the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere
joke should lead to such consequences.â€

â€œBut who perpetrated that joke, let me ask? neither you nor myself, but
Fernand; you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the
roomâ€”indeed, I fancied I had destroyed it.â€

â€œOh, no,â€ replied Caderousse, â€œthat I can answer for, you did not. I
only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed
and crumpled in a corner of the arbor.â€

â€œWell, then, if you did, depend upon it, Fernand picked it up, and
either copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not
take the trouble of recopying it. And now I think of it, by Heavens, he
may have sent the letter itself! Fortunately, for me, the handwriting
was disguised.â€

â€œThen you were aware of DantÃ¨s being engaged in a conspiracy?â€

â€œNot I. As I before said, I thought the whole thing was a joke, nothing
more. It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the
truth.â€

â€œStill,â€ argued Caderousse, â€œI would give a great deal if nothing of
the kind had happened; or, at least, that I had had no hand in it. You
will see, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of
us.â€

â€œNonsense! If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person;
and that, you know, is Fernand. How can we be implicated in any way?
All we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly
quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that
the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.â€

â€œAmen!â€ responded Caderousse, waving his hand in token of adieu to
Danglars, and bending his steps towards the AllÃ©es de Meilhan, moving
his head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of one
whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.

â€œSo far, then,â€ said Danglars, mentally, â€œall has gone as I would have
it. I am, temporarily, commander of the _Pharaon_, with the certainty
of being permanently so, if that fool of a Caderousse can be persuaded
to hold his tongue. My only fear is the chance of DantÃ¨s being
released. But, there, he is in the hands of Justice; and,â€ added he
with a smile, â€œshe will take her own.â€ So saying, he leaped into a
boat, desiring to be rowed on board the _Pharaon_, where M. Morrel had
agreed to meet him.



 Chapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi

In one of the aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand
Cours opposite the Medusa fountain, a second marriage feast was being
celebrated, almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by
DantÃ¨s. In this case, however, although the occasion of the
entertainment was similar, the company was strikingly dissimilar.
Instead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to
the humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the
very flower of Marseilles society,â€”magistrates who had resigned their
office during the usurperâ€™s reign; officers who had deserted from the
imperial army and joined forces with CondÃ©; and younger members of
families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of
exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate
to the rank of a god.

The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic
conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive
passions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily,
for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness
to the violence of party feeling.

The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held
sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a
small population of five or six thousand souls,â€”after having been
accustomed to hear the â€œ_Vive NapolÃ©ons_â€ of a hundred and twenty
millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,â€”was
looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh
connection with France or claim to her throne.

The magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military
part of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while
the women commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the
downfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that
they rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and
cheering prospect of a revivified political existence.

An old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and
proposed the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de
Saint-MÃ©ran. This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of
Hartwell and the peace-loving King of France, excited universal
enthusiasm; glasses were elevated in the air _Ã  lâ€™Anglaise_, and the
ladies, snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the
table with their floral treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor
prevailed.

â€œAh,â€ said the Marquise de Saint-MÃ©ran, a woman with a stern,
forbidding eye, though still noble and distinguished in appearance,
despite her fifty yearsâ€”â€œah, these revolutionists, who have driven us
from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle
during the Reign of Terror, would be compelled to own, were they here,
that all true devotion was on our side, since we were content to follow
the fortunes of a falling monarch, while they, on the contrary, made
their fortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes, yes, they could not
help admitting that the king, for whom we sacrificed rank, wealth, and
station was truly our â€˜Louis the well-beloved,â€™ while their wretched
usurper has been, and ever will be, to them their evil genius, their
â€˜Napoleon the accursed.â€™ Am I not right, Villefort?â€

â€œI beg your pardon, madame. I really must pray you to excuse me, butâ€”in
truthâ€”I was not attending to the conversation.â€

â€œMarquise, marquise!â€ interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the
toast, â€œlet the young people alone; let me tell you, on oneâ€™s wedding
day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry
politics.â€

â€œNever mind, dearest mother,â€ said a young and lovely girl, with a
profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid
crystal, â€œâ€™tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to
prevent his listening to what you said. But thereâ€”now take himâ€”he is
your own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my
mother speaks to you.â€

â€œIf the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly
caught, I shall be delighted to answer,â€ said M. de Villefort.

â€œNever mind, RenÃ©e,â€ replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness
that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however
all other feelings may be withered in a womanâ€™s nature, there is always
one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the
shrine of maternal love. â€œI forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort,
was, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or
devotion.â€

â€œThey had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,â€
replied the young man, â€œand that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the
Mahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious
followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the
personification of equality.â€

â€œHe!â€ cried the marquise: â€œNapoleon the type of equality! For mercyâ€™s
sake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip
the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to
my mind, has usurped quite enough.â€

0085m



â€œNay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right
pedestalâ€”that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze;
that of Napoleon on the column of the Place VendÃ´me. The only
difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated
by these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the
equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the
guillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.
Observe,â€ said Villefort, smiling, â€œI do not mean to deny that both
these men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and
the 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy
of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil
order; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust
he is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical
satellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other
usurpersâ€”Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon,
had his partisans and advocates.â€

â€œDo you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully
revolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the
son of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.â€ A
deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.

â€œâ€™Tis true, madame,â€ answered he, â€œthat my father was a Girondin, but
he was not among the number of those who voted for the kingâ€™s death; he
was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had
well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father
perished.â€

â€œTrue,â€ replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree
at the tragic remembrance thus called up; â€œbut bear in mind, if you
please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and
proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which
I may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest
adherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining
the new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,
the Count Noirtier became a senator.â€

â€œDear mother,â€ interposed RenÃ©e, â€œyou know very well it was agreed that
all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.â€

â€œSuffer me, also, madame,â€ replied Villefort, â€œto add my earnest
request to Mademoiselle de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s, that you will kindly allow
the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails
recrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have
laid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his
political principles. He wasâ€”nay, probably may still beâ€”a Bonapartist,
and is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a staunch royalist, and
style myself de Villefort. Let what may remain of revolutionary sap
exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to
regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the
parent tree, without having the power, any more than the wish, to
separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.â€

â€œBravo, Villefort!â€ cried the marquis; â€œexcellently well said! Come,
now, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring
to persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and
forgetfulness of the past.â€

â€œWith all my heart,â€ replied the marquise; â€œlet the past be forever
forgotten. I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive
it as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and
inflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,
Villefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your
fealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king
consented to forget the past, as I doâ€ (and here she extended to him
her hand)â€”â€œas I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should
there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the
government, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence
with rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected
family.â€

â€œAlas, madame,â€ returned Villefort, â€œmy profession, as well as the
times in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already
successfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the
offenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing
yet.â€

0087m



â€œDo you, indeed, think so?â€ inquired the marquise.

â€œI am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too
near France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.
Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one
frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;
from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of
persons, and assassinations in the lower.â€

â€œYou have heard, perhaps,â€ said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de
Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte dâ€™Artois,
â€œthat the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?â€

â€œYes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,â€ said M. de
Saint-MÃ©ran; â€œand where is it decided to transfer him?â€

â€œTo Saint Helena.â€

â€œFor heavenâ€™s sake, where is that?â€ asked the marquise.

â€œAn island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two
thousand leagues from here,â€ replied the count.

â€œSo much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly
to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,
of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the
sovereignty of which he coveted for his son.â€

â€œUnfortunately,â€ said Villefort, â€œthere are the treaties of 1814, and
we cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.â€

â€œOh, well, we shall find some way out of it,â€ responded M. de Salvieux.
â€œThere wasnâ€™t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of
shooting the poor Duc dâ€™Enghien.â€

â€œWell,â€ said the marquise, â€œit seems probable that, by the aid of the
Holy Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the
vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans. The
king is either a king or no king; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of
France, he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity; and this can
best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down
every attempt at conspiracyâ€”â€™tis the best and surest means of
preventing mischief.â€

â€œUnfortunately, madame,â€ answered Villefort, â€œthe strong arm of the law
is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place.â€

â€œThen all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it.â€

â€œNay, madame, the law is frequently powerless to effect this; all it
can do is to avenge the wrong done.â€

â€œOh, M. de Villefort,â€ cried a beautiful young creature, daughter to
the Comte de Salvieux, and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de
Saint-MÃ©ran, â€œdo try and get up some famous trial while we are at
Marseilles. I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so very
amusing!â€

â€œAmusing, certainly,â€ replied the young man, â€œinasmuch as, instead of
shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre,
you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distressâ€”a drama
of life. The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and alarmed,
instead ofâ€”as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedyâ€”going home
to sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he
may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,â€”is removed from your sight
merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the
executioner. I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to
bear you through such a scene. Of this, however, be assured, that
should any favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to
offer you the choice of being present.â€

â€œFor shame, M. de Villefort!â€ said RenÃ©e, becoming quite pale; â€œdonâ€™t
you see how you are frightening us?â€”and yet you laugh.â€

â€œWhat would you have? â€™Tis like a duel. I have already recorded
sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political
conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened,
and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?â€

â€œGracious heavens, M. de Villefort,â€ said RenÃ©e, becoming more and more
terrified; â€œyou surely are not in earnest.â€

â€œIndeed I am,â€ replied the young magistrate with a smile; â€œand in the
interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would
only be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as
is more than probable, to have served under Napoleonâ€”well, can you
expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his
commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will
scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be
his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely
because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one
requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in
order to lash oneâ€™s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and
power. I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile,
as though in mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused
pale, agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire
of my eloquence.â€ RenÃ©e uttered a smothered exclamation.

â€œBravo!â€ cried one of the guests; â€œthat is what I call talking to some
purpose.â€

â€œJust the person we require at a time like the present,â€ said a second.

â€œWhat a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear
Villefort!â€ remarked a third; â€œI mean the trial of the man for
murdering his father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner
had laid his hand upon him.â€

â€œOh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,â€ interposed
RenÃ©e, â€œit matters very little what is done to them; but as regards
poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed
themselves up in political intriguesâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhy, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit; for,
donâ€™t you see, RenÃ©e, the king is the father of his people, and he who
shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent
of thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully great
scale?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know anything about that,â€ replied RenÃ©e; â€œbut, M. de
Villefort, you have promised meâ€”have you not?â€”always to show mercy to
those I plead for.â€

â€œMake yourself quite easy on that point,â€ answered Villefort, with one
of his sweetest smiles; â€œyou and I will always consult upon our
verdicts.â€

â€œMy love,â€ said the marquise, â€œattend to your doves, your lap-dogs, and
embroidery, but do not meddle with what you do not understand. Nowadays
the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the
badge of honor. There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in
point.â€

â€œ_Cedant arma togÃ¦_,â€ said Villefort with a bow.

â€œI cannot speak Latin,â€ responded the marquise.

â€œWell,â€ said RenÃ©e, â€œI cannot help regretting you had not chosen some
other profession than your ownâ€”a physician, for instance. Do you know I
always felt a shudder at the idea of even a _destroying_ angel?â€

â€œDear, good RenÃ©e,â€ whispered Villefort, as he gazed with unutterable
tenderness on the lovely speaker.

â€œLet us hope, my child,â€ cried the marquis, â€œthat M. de Villefort may
prove the moral and political physician of this province; if so, he
will have achieved a noble work.â€

â€œAnd one which will go far to efface the recollection of his fatherâ€™s
conduct,â€ added the incorrigible marquise.

â€œMadame,â€ replied Villefort, with a mournful smile, â€œI have already had
the honor to observe that my father hasâ€”at least, I hope soâ€”abjured his
past errors, and that he is, at the present moment, a firm and zealous
friend to religion and orderâ€”a better royalist, possibly, than his son;
for he has to atone for past dereliction, while I have no other impulse
than warm, decided preference and conviction.â€ Having made this
well-turned speech, Villefort looked carefully around to mark the
effect of his oratory, much as he would have done had he been
addressing the bench in open court.

â€œDo you know, my dear Villefort,â€ cried the Comte de Salvieux, â€œthat is
exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries, when
questioned by his majestyâ€™s principal chamberlain touching the
singularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the
daughter of an officer of the Duc de CondÃ©; and I assure you he seemed
fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences
was based upon sound and excellent principles. Then the king, who,
without our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted
us by saying, â€˜Villefortâ€™â€”observe that the king did not pronounce the
word Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on
that of Villefortâ€”â€˜Villefort,â€™ said his majesty, â€˜is a young man of
great judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his
profession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that
he was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de
Saint-MÃ©ran. I should myself have recommended the match, had not the
noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.â€™â€

â€œIs it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express
himself so favorably of me?â€ asked the enraptured Villefort.

â€œI give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he
will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to
him, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of
your espousing his daughter.â€

0091m



â€œThat is true,â€ answered the marquis.

â€œHow much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not do
to evince my earnest gratitude!â€

â€œThat is right,â€ cried the marquise. â€œI love to see you thus. Now,
then, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most
welcome.â€

â€œFor my part, dear mother,â€ interposed RenÃ©e, â€œI trust your wishes will
not prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor
debtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefortâ€™s
hands,â€”then I shall be contented.â€

â€œJust the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be
called upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of
wasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to
see me the kingâ€™s attorney, you must desire for me some of those
violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor
redounds to the physician.â€

At this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefortâ€™s wish had
sufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and
whispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table
and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon,
however, returned, his whole face beaming with delight. RenÃ©e regarded
him with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as
they then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed
to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful
and intelligent lover.

â€œYou were wishing just now,â€ said Villefort, addressing her, â€œthat I
were a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the
disciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in
1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my
betrothal.â€

â€œAnd wherefore were you called away just now?â€ asked Mademoiselle de
Saint-MÃ©ran, with an air of deep interest.

â€œFor a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the
executioner.â€

â€œHow dreadful!â€ exclaimed RenÃ©e, turning pale.

â€œIs it possible?â€ burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to
the magistrate to hear his words.

â€œWhy, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy
has just been discovered.â€

â€œCan I believe my ears?â€ cried the marquise.

â€œI will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,â€ said
Villefort:

â€œâ€˜The kingâ€™s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the
religious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond DantÃ¨s,
mate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having
touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter
from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter
from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration
of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned
Edmond DantÃ¨s, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him,
or has it at his fatherâ€™s abode. Should it not be found in the
possession of father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in
the cabin belonging to the said DantÃ¨s on board the _Pharaon_.â€™â€

â€œBut,â€ said RenÃ©e, â€œthis letter, which, after all, is but an anonymous
scrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the kingâ€™s attorney.â€

â€œTrue; but that gentleman b
